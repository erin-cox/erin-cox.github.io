<h2>What is a Swiss tournament?</h2>

<p>A Swiss tournament is a kind of tournament system commonly used for games or sports with head-to-head matches. There are a fixed number of rounds in the tournament, but far fewer than there would be in a round-robin tournament (where every competitor plays every other competitor). Competitors are matched in each round with a competitor they've never played before who has a similar score to them in the tournament so far. Every competitor plays in every round (except when there is an odd number of competitors, in which case one competitor sits out per round). The winner is the player with the highest overall score (with potential tie-breaks).</p>

<p>The advantages of a Swiss tournament are that everyone plays in every round in a league format, but with significantly fewer games than a round-robin tournament would require. The disadvantages of a Swiss tournament are that there are no climaxes (as it is a league format rather than elimination) and that it does not deal with the problem of wide-ranging skill level any better than elimination formats (unlike the McMahon system which does).</p>

<p>The most important aspect of Swiss tournament is the pairing rules. All Swiss tournaments ensure that no competitors play each other twice (so there should be fewer rounds than competitors).</p>
