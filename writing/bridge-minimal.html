  <li>What&#8217;s the minimum HCP needed between a partnership to have a cold grand slam?</li>
  <li>What&#8217;s the minimum HCP needed between a partnership to be cold for 7NT?</li>
  <li>(My favourite) Can a pair be cold for game with 0 HCP?</li>
</ol>

<p>For each question, provide a layout of all four hands (the enemy distribution may be manipulated in your favour) and/or argue why it&#8217;s not possible to do better. (Recall that HCP means High Card Points (Ace=4, King=3, Queen=2, Jack=1) and a contract is <em>cold</em> if it is guaranteed to make regardless of the defence.)</p>

    <p>5 HCP. The ace of trumps is clearly necessary, as is at least the jack of trumps, in which case the ace can drop the king and queen singleton in each opponent&#8217;s hand. North&ndash;South are cold for 7♠️ on the following layout:</p>
    <table class="bridge-layout">
      <tr><td></td><td>♠️5432<br>♥️<br>♦️T98765432<br>♣️</td><td></td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>♠️K<br>♥️AQT864<br>♦️AQ<br>♣️KJ97</td><td></td>
        <td>♠️Q<br>♥️KJ975<br>♦️KJ<br>♣️AQT86</td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>♠️AJT9876<br>♥️32<br>♦️<br>♣️5432</td><td></td></tr>
    </table>
  </li>

    <p>11 HCP. At first glance, it may seem like all four aces are necessary to control each suit for the first trick. However, the opponent on opening lead can be given two voids, negating the need for two of those aces. By the same reasoning as the first part, a jack is necessary, but 9 HCP is only enough for 12 tricks: at least a queen is needed for the 13th.</p>
    <table class="bridge-layout">
      <tr><td></td><td>♠️<br>♥️<br>♦️8765432<br>♣️765432</td><td></td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>♠️K<br>♥️KQJT98765432<br>♦️<br>♣️</td><td></td>
        <td>♠️<br>♥️<br>♦️AKQJT9<br>♣️AKQJT98</td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>♠️AQJT98765432<br>♥️A<br>♦️<br>♣️</td><td></td></tr>

    <p>Yes, they can. North&ndash;South are cold for 4♠️ on the layout below:</p>
    <table class="bridge-layout">
      <tr><td></td><td>♠️9753<br>♥️2<br>♦️T9876543<br>♣️</td><td></td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>♠️AQ<br>♥️KJ<br>♦️AQ2<br>♣️KJ9753</td><td></td>
        <td>♠️KJ<br>♥️AQ<br>♦️KJ<br>♣️AQT8642</td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>♠️T8642<br>♥️T9876543<br>♦️<br>♣️</td><td></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>East&ndash;West are clearly cold for 7NT, but that&#8217;s beside the point.</p>
  </li>
