<p>TODO: dfagdlfgft.</p>

<p>This theorem is important for cardinal arithmetic. For any sets \(A\) and \(B\), \(|A| = |B|\) is defined as true iff there is a bijection between \(A\) and \(B\). The Cantor&ndash;Schröder&ndash;Bernstein theorem proves that if &ldquo;\(|A| \leq |B|\) and \(|A| \geq |B|\), then \(|A| = |B|\)&rdquo; holds for any sets \(A\) and \(B\), even if those cardinalities are weird far-off infinities, and that therefore \(|\_|\leq|\_|\) is a partial order on sets (reflexivity and transitivity are trivial to show, and this shows antisymmetry). (Whether cardinalities form a total order is apparently equivalent to the axiom of choice; the axiom of choice implies this result due to well-ordering, and as for the inverse, apparently people have come up with models of ZF with infinite Dedekind-finite sets, which are incomparable in cardinality with \(\mathbb{N}\).) fix this as well
</p>

<h2>Statement 1</h2>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If there exist injective functions \(f : A \to B\) and \(g : B \to A\) for sets \(A\) and \(B\), there exists a bijection \(h : A \to B\).</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Recall that \(f\) being injective means that \(f(a_1)=f(a_2)\) \(\implies\) \(a_1=a_2\). Hence \(f\) has a partial inverse function \(f^{-1} : B \rightharpoonup A\).</p>

<p>Assume without loss of generality that \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint. For each \(a\) in \(A\) define the sequence \(s_a\) as</p>

\[
\cdots \;\;\;\;\;\
 f^{-1}g^{-1}(a) \;\;\;\;\;\
 g^{-1}(a)\;\;\;\;\;\
 a\;\;\;\;\;\
  f(a)\;\;\;\;\;\
 gf(a)\;\;\;\;\;\
 fgf(a)\;\;\;\;\;\
 \cdots
\]

<p>which may terminate to the left at some \(\ell_a\in A \sqcup B\) on which neither \(f^{-1}\) nor \(g^{-1}\) are defined. Since the sequences \(s_a\) partition \(A \sqcup B\), it suffices to consider the elements within each sequence individually.</p>

<p>For each sequence \(s_a\), if \(\ell_a \in A\) then \(f^{-1}\) is total on \(B\)-elements of \(s_a\); if \(\ell_a \in B\) then \(g^{-1}\) is total on \(A\)-elements of \(s_a\); and if \(\ell_a\) is undefined, both \(f^{-1}\) and \(g^{-1}\) are total on their respective halves of \(s_a\). Hence at least one of \(f\) and \(g\) is bijective for every sequence \(s_a\). \(\square\)</p>

<h2>Statement 2</h2>

<p><strong>Question.</strong> We have a (potentially infinite) set of red and black counters<a id="counter-return" href="#counter-footnote">¹</a> with arrows pointing between them such that every black counter has exactly one arrow pointing from it to a red counter, and every red counter has exactly one arrow pointing from it to a black counter. No two arrows point at the same counter. Show that the black counters and red counters can be put in one-to-one correspondence with one another.</p>

<p><strong>Answer.</strong> For any black counter, follow the chain of arrows both forwards and backwards from it. (By assumption there are either zero or one arrows pointing at any given counter, so there is no ambiguity in going backwards.) The counter in each chain alternate between black and red.</p>

<p>Every counter is in exactly one such chain (every counter is in a chain because every counter has exactly one arrow pointing away from it; no counter can be in two chains, because it would need two arrows both either pointing away from or toward it). Therefore we can put the counters in one-to-one correspondence by putting the counters within each chain in one-to-one correspondence, then combining all the chains together.</p>

<p>Consider a single chain \(C\). We either have some starting counter \(s\) which has no arrow pointing at it, or following the arrows backwards never ends.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If \(s\) exists and is black, then not every black in \(C\) has a red behind it (because \(s\) doesn&#8217;t), but every red in \(C\) does have a black behind it.</li>
  <li>If \(s\) exists and is red, then not every red in \(C\) has a black behind it (because \(s\) doesn&#8217;t), but every black in \(C\) does have a red behind it.</li>
  <li>If \(s\) doesn&#8217;t exist, then both colours always have a counter of the opposite colour behind them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore we can put the red and black counters in \(C\) in one-to-one correspondence by taking the colour opposite to \(s\) (or either colour if \(s\) doesn&#8217;t exist) and putting it next to the counter behind it.</p>

<h2>Some thoughts about this</h2>

<p>The proof with arrows seems to me to be easier to grasp intuitively, especially to those with less mathematical background. I think someone with no maths knowledge at all could understand the second proof.</p>

<p>One of the downsides of the proof with counters is that the mental image of arrows drawn between opposing columns of counters makes assumptions that aren&#8217;t in the condition. Our sets can be uncountably infinitely large, but no amount of adding ellipses \(\cdots\) to our counters and arrows will prevent us from visually assuming the infinities are countable. While it&#8217;s true that this is a poor example because that assumption doesn&#8217;t matter here, there are a lot of problems where hidden assumptions like this cause headaches, like in this infamous proof that <a href="http://jdh.hamkins.org/all-triangles-are-isosceles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">all triangles are equilateral</a>.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the importance of both intuition and formal reasoning in maths and how with practice we can develop a more rigorous intuition. Though this is a fine sentiment, what concerns me is what strike me as fundamental limitations of unifying the two. To take visualisation as an example, if we allow the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any visualisation of all of the elements of a set at once based on considering the elements individually must by definition assume countability. (I&#8217;m not necessarily convinced by this, but assume it for now.)</li>
  <li>There exists a mathematical problem \(\mathcal{M}\)<a id="bad-example-return" href="#bad-example-footnote">²</a> such that:
    <ul>
      <li>\(\mathcal{M}\) deals with some general set \(X\) that may be uncountable;</li>
      <li>visualising all the elements of \(X\) at once makes it strictly easier for us to think about \(\mathcal{M}\) than intuition-about-formal-reasoning alone;</li>
      <li>In the process of solving \(\mathcal{M}\) we are likely to encounter some useful proposition, true for countable sets, false in general, for which the only way to avoid errors in reasoning is to drop that visualisation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>then it is implied that we must do both intuition and formal reasoning separately if we want to both effective and correct. (There are probably more examples of &ldquo;inaccessible&rdquo; intuitions, but this is the one that came to mind.) I find this slightly disquieting because I&#8217;m sympathetic to the idea that we can reinstate our best intuitions on a foundation of rigour and treat them as one, and it seems to be a common idea. This argument would appear to show that in some cases we have no choice but to rely on demonstrably wrong intuitions to solve some problems as effectively as we can, and these intuitions provably can&#8217;t be patched up or suitably replaced, ever. (I have a feeling that physics student friends will tell me they knew this from the beginning&#8230;) But whether this is true or obvious to physicists, does it apply to certain fields or problems more than others? Are some problems free of this?</p>

<p>On a separate note, I&#8217;m not sure there is one best way to state the original problem. The statement about injective functions requires a mathematical background, but is concise and makes the theory easier to leverage. The statement about counters and arrows requires no background at all and is so useful that I would give it with any demonstration just for clarity, but has the aforementioned problem with infinities and requires a bit more reading and thought to piece together the translation of injectivity and bijectivity to conditions on arrows. (I&#8217;m reminded of the word problems in maths and computer science contests&mdash;maybe the label X in &ldquo;oh this problem is just X&rdquo; gives us material help compared to reasoning out in a raw fashion with whatever widgets a given word problem involves.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the counters-and-arrows proof isn't any less rigorous, since I think there&#8217;s an unjust trend of calling reasoning with household objects or shapes etc. unrigorous (maybe mixing up &ldquo;informal&rdquo;), though happily there are plenty of examples to the contrary e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">stars and bars</a>).</p>

<h2>By the way</h2>

<p>The Cantor&ndash;Schröder&ndash;Bernstein theorem does not hold constructively (the proof above used the excluded middle several times in the case analyses), but there is an analogue in computability theory called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myhill_isomorphism_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Myhill isomorphism theorem</a>. Two sets \(A,B \subseteq \mathbb{N}\) are said to be <em>computably isomorphic</em> if there is a total computable bijection \(f : A \to B\) with \(f(A)=B\). TODO: brain dead</p>

    <p id="counter-footnote">More precisely: we have a very large number of counters (you can&#8230; sort of choose how many). Some may be black, some may be red, some may be both red and black. (There may be infinitely many of any or all of these categories, and some of those infinities might be bigger than others&#8230;) The proof would then say &ldquo;Let&#8217;s not worry about a counter being both red and black, because the argument is just as valid if there aren&#8217;t any&rdquo;, and it would be right. It wouldn&#8217;t bother mentioning any blue counters, because they&#8217;re irrelevant (unless they are red or black as well). <a href="#counter-return">&uarr;</a></p>
