<p>Hello! My name is Erin Cox and I&#8217;m a programmer by vocation and musician by avocation living in London.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a pianist, organist and composer with ample experience in solo, chamber and orchestral performance. I was organ scholar at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. My composition portfolio can be found under <a href="/music" class="section">music</a>.</p>

<p>I write posts about topics such as maths, computer science and language orthography every now and then and upload them here under <a href="/posts" class="section">posts</a>.
