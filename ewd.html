<p>Edsger W. Dijkstra was a Dutch computer scientist, mathematician and essayist.</p>

I adore Dijkstra's essays for their crisp, uncompromising style, dunwavering commitment to mathematical rigour and

He understood that simplicity was far more than an aesthetic quality.

Dijkstra penned more than 1300 articles during his lifetime, all of which remain unpublished.

All of the EWD manuscripts, of which there are over 1300, remain unpublished, though scans and some transcriptions are available online from the Dijkstra archive of the University of Texas at Austin.
